# GI0
Created as part of DATA501, Semester 2, 2023.

This package contains functions for the $\mathcal{G}_I^0$ distribution. The functions are:

- `dGI0` gives the density for the $\mathcal{G}_I^0$ distribution
- `pGI0` gives the cumulative distribution function for the $\mathcal{G}_I^0$ distribution
- `qGI0` gives the quantile function for the $\mathcal{G}_I^0$ distribution
- `rGI0` is a pseudo-random number generator for sampling from the $\mathcal{G}_I^0$ distribution

The functions were modified to check that valid parameters are passed when called.

Documentation for each function was created using `roxygen2`. 

A vignette was created to outline how to use each function.
